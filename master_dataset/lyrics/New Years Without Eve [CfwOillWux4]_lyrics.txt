I'm not a man. I'm not a man. Signs are the times. I pick attention. Signs I ask for and then somebody sent them. The colony that lions crests mates for a dazzling emblem. I don't always write, but when I do it, it's open and it's times. I pay attention. Told the ventures and some heat and this is what was sent in. I just favor niggas, tweezks, they ain't worth the mention. I see the vision. Three dimensions. This is the first dimension. Times. Conversations with the oracles she say looking back. This gonna be historical. I don't know if niggas really uphold the same moral code. So we brought it ways. That's it. That's how the story goes. Man, times are ticking. Ain't waiting for no man. I see my bitch anti-abortion, but she get with the program. She asks what's the matter. You mean besides the ones that I take into my own hands? Signs are the times. I pay attention. Signs I ask for and then somebody sent them. The colony that lions crests mates for a dazzling emblem. If my niggas go to war, then I'm going with them. Times. On your hands, so you niggas ferry. I'm always there in spirits, so I'm never disappearing. My grandma prayers guide me these are dangerous times they're wearing. My father met my mother, then I made a guest appearance. Times. I pay attention. Signs I ask for and then somebody sent them. The colony that lions crests mates for a dazzling emblem. I don't always write, but when I do it's open in this size. A fucking figment of my imagination. These are dangerous times we live in. These bitches bad as fuck. I swear sometimes I want to give in. They always ask and when I make it if I'm going to remember. I'm going to remember. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times. Times.
