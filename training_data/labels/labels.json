    "I'm not a man. I'm not a man. Signs are the times. I pick attention. Signs I ask for and then somebody sent them. The colony that lions crests mates for a dazzling emblem. I don't always write, but when I do it, it's open and it's times. I pay attention. Told the ventures and some heat and this is what was sent in. I just favor niggas, tweezks, they ain't worth the mention. I see the vision. Three dimensions. This is the first dimension. Times. Conversations with the oracles she say looking back. This gonna be historical. I don't know if niggas really uphold the same moral code. So we brought it ways. That's it. That's how the story goes. Man, times are ticking. Ain't waiting for no man. I see my bitch anti-abortion, but she get with the program. She asks what's the matter. You mean besides the ones that I take into my own hands? Signs are the times. I pay attention. Signs I ask for and then somebody sent them. The colony that lions crests mates for a dazzling emblem. If my niggas go to war, then I'm going with them. Times. On your hands, so you niggas ferry.
